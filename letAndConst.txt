- What is the difference between ***var*** and ***let***?

var is function scoped whereas let is blocked scoped this means
 that var can be accessed anywhere in function
 and let can only be acsessed where it is declared through block in function


- What is the difference between **var** and ***const***?

const is block scoped var is function scoped,const also cannot be redeclared
and it also needs to have a variable to be ran or initialized ex: const dog; vs const dog = [doggy, jackrussel]
unlike var , that can be accessed almost anywhere and can be redeclared.

- What is the difference between **let** and **const**?

Both are block scoped, both cannot be redeclared , but let can be reassigned.
Const has to be declared first to be initialized let can change through code but const is a set variable.



- What is hoisting?

Hoisting is when declarations are moved to the top of the scope like var
before the code is executed
